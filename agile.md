TO DO:

* ALWAYS MAKE gradle.properties FILE AND PUT API KEYS IN THERE! THIS FILE SHOULD BE IN THE GIT IGNORE, SO IT WILL ALWAYS BE GONE WHEN YOU PULL IT DOWN!
* SWAP OUT EXPANDABLE LIST WITH RECYCLER VIEW
* SET UP FIREBASE? TRY LOCAL SAVE W/ SQL? CAN I CALL THIS W/ OKHTTP OR DO I STILL NEED API?
* DON'T FORGET YOU ARE ON NEW BRANCH TO NOT MESS UP MASTER
* DOES GOOGLE PLACES NEED GOOGLE PLAY? 

* As a user, I want to be able to pass items from one list to another.
* As a user, I want to be able to enter an item on a shopping or pantry list.
* As a user, I want to be able to edit and delete individual items.
* As as user, I want to be able to see generally when my food will expire (if we have time)
* As a user, I want to be able to see which items are on the shopping list and which items are on the pantry list.


DONE:



PENDING:

* Replace ExpandableListView with RecyclerView? Which can better grab data from Firebase?
